# my-project-templates


## What is this

This implements an Android Studio project template to create new project
in Android Studio.

The template is based on my List/Detail app based on my [Rick & Morty](https://github.com/jamesonwilliams/rick-morty-compose/tree/main) demo app.

The template accepts an item name, which will be used widely around the project for file naming and model naming. For example, your list detail app might list animals, and show details on a particular Animal.

The project also accepts a URL which will be plugged into Retrofit.

## Where did it come from?

This is a fork of [Sasikanth](https://sasikanth.dev/creating-project-templates-in-android-studio/)'s project.

More details on how to build/deploy the plugin are in [Sasikanth](https://www.sasikanth.dev/creating-project-templates-in-android-studio/)'s blog.

Thank you to Sasikanth for his earlier work.

## Versioning Status

Currently I've tested the project build in IntelliJ IDEA 2023.3, using the plugin in Android Studio Hedgehog (2023.1.1).
